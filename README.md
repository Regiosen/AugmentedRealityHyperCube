# Augmented Reality Hyper Cube
A project made with Unity and ARtoolkit

This project is a 3d maze that is visible through the camera of the device it is run in. 
Once one of the 6 marks accepted by the application is detected, the program will show a room where the mark is.
A ball can be navigated from one room to another starting with the "water drop" mark room.
To move the ball, one must physicaly tilt the marks
