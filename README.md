# Augmented Reality Hyper Cube
A project made with Unity and ARtoolkit

This project is a 3d maze that is visible through the device's camera. 
Once one of the marks is detected, the program will show a room replacing it.
A ball can be navigated from one room to another starting with the "water drop" mark room.
To move the ball, one must tilt the marks
